# movie-scraper
Simple web scraper to track the performance of the BARBENHEIMER phenomenon. Wanted to set it up to run automatically but as of now haven't been able to get launchd running, so settled for calling manually at somewhat regular intervals. 

It should be noted: I think I could get it to work pretty easily with a cron-job and when I get a raspberry pi to act as a server, I plan to set it up like that, but for the time being, this is what I have.
